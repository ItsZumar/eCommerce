            1: Can we place order online and what are payment options?
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom>
            Of course, you can place orders online. Upon confirmation of your
            payment, we will dispatch your order as soon as possible. Total time
            is based on the amount of time it takes to get payment
            authorization, order processing, and the transit time from the
            carrier. This can range from 24 hours to 10 days for in-stock items.
            To avoid delays, please ensure that you have provided us with the
            correct Shipping address.

            3: Do the prices of On Order Products Change?
          </Typography>
          <Typography gutterBottom>
            We do everything to ensure that the prices on our website are
            correct and try to keep prices constant. Sometimes we need to change
            the prices, either up or down without any prior notice due to change
            in Forex rates/government policies. E-Commerce reserves the right to
            change the prices on the website at any time without prior notice.
            In that case, if you have ordered the product but not yet confirmed
            or you have even paid for a product the prices would not be valid.
            It's better to confirm the price's of On Order Product's through
            phone call first and then deposit the amount after confirmation.
